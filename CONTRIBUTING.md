# Contributing to nativescript-vue

If you feel like contributing to this project, that is awesome! This guide should help you get started.

# Pull Request Guidelines

- It's OK to submit PR against the `master` branch
- It's OK to have multiple commits per PR (will be squashed during merge)
- Please describe the changes in every PR, to make it easier to review. (No empty PR descriptions please)

We will re-iterate these guidelines as the project matures.

# Contributing to docs

Refer to the [nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue.org repository](https://github.com/nativescript-vue/nativescript-vue.org)

# Development setup

You will need Node.js (>=10.18.1) installed, as well as NativeScript.

Please make sure you are using Nativescript 6.x

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash
$ cd nativescript-vue
$ yarn
```

# Commonly used scripts

```bash
$ # watch and auto re-build dist/index.js
$ yarn dev
```

# Testing with the sample application(s)

To test the sample applications provided in the repository, you need to `yarn dev` in the root directory. This will watch for changes, and rebuild nativescript-vue, which in dev mode will be generated into the samples/app directory (this has been done to reduce the required steps of linking local packages, which had many issues with the recent releases of npm).

Next, open up a new terminal window and change directory to samples `cd samples`.

If you want to test the sample apps, please run `ns run <platform> --no-hmr` (disabling hmr isn't necessary, but preferred most of the time).

To test a different/new sample edit `app/entry.js` and update the `require('./<sample>')` statement to require any of the samples in the app folder.

# Troubleshooting

#### Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to your JAVA 8 JDK!

If JAVA_HOME isn't set correctly, then `yarn samples` will exit back to the command prompt after prompting for a sample and platform.

Mac:
```
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v1.8`
```

#### Deploying to Android on MacOS fails due to a `ENFILE: file table overflow ...` error.

If you see an error like this:
```
Transferring project files...
Multiple errors were thrown:
ENFILE: file table overflow, open '/(...)/file-name-resolver/package.json'
```
it means you have to increase the file limits (see: [http://stackoverflow.com/a/27982223](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27982223)). You can do that with:
```
echo kern.maxfiles=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
ulimit -n 65536 65536
```
